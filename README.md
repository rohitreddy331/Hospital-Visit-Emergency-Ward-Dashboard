# 🚑 Emergency Room Visits Dashboard

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing emergency room (ER) visit patterns using real-world data from DataWorld. The goal is to provide actionable insights into patient demographics, wait times, and departmental efficiency through an interactive Emergency Room Dashboard.

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) → Data preprocessing and analysis

Tableau → Dashboard visualization

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization and trend analysis

Yahoo_fin & Requests-HTML → Data extraction and integration

# 📊 Key Analyses & Insights

# 👥 Patient Demographics

Total ER visits analyzed: 9,216

Gender distribution: 51.05% male, 48.69% female, 0.26% non-classified

Most common patient age group: 19-65 years (largest share of ER visits)

# Race distribution:

White (2,571 patients)

African American (1,951 patients)

Two or More Races (1,557 patients)

Other groups: Asian (1,060), Declined to Identify (1,030), Pacific Islander (549), Native American (498)

# 🏥 Department Utilization

General Practice (1,840 visits) & Orthopedics (995 visits) are the busiest ER departments

Lower visit counts were observed in Physiotherapy, Cardiology, Neurology, Gastroenterology, and Renal departments, indicating these may be less frequent emergency needs

# ⏳ Wait Time & Patient Satisfaction

Average ER wait time: 35.26 minutes

Average patient satisfaction score: 4.99/10 (indicating room for improvement)

Peak wait times occur between 2 AM - 6 AM, suggesting possible understaffing during these hours

# 🔥 Emergency Room Heatmap Trends

Wait times exceed 38 minutes between 2 AM - 6 AM 📈

Lowest wait times are observed during early morning hours (12 AM - 1 AM) and late mornings 📉

# 🏆 Final Insights & Recommendations for Hospitals

Optimize Staffing During Peak Wait Times ⏳

Reduce congestion by increasing ER staff between 2 AM - 6 AM.

Implement triage improvements to accelerate patient intake.

Improve Patient Satisfaction 👍

Reduce waiting times to increase patient satisfaction beyond 4.99/10.

Implement real-time status updates for patients to improve the waiting experience.

# Enhance Efficiency in Busiest Departments 🏥

General Practice & Orthopedics need better resource allocation due to high visit volumes.

Deploy dedicated staff and triage nurses to handle high-patient influx.

# Focus on Underutilized Departments 📊

Evaluate low emergency visit rates in Physiotherapy, Cardiology, and Neurology.

Consider reallocation of resources to more in-demand departments.

# Diversity & Inclusion Considerations 🌎

African American, Asian, and Native American patients form a significant portion of ER visits.

Improve culturally sensitive care & accessibility for minority groups.
